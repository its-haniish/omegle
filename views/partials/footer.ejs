      <h3>About Omegle.lat</h3>
      <p>
        Omegle.lat is a modern take on classic random video chat platforms,
        designed and developed by <strong>Toxiic</strong>. Since 2019, our
        mission has been to connect people across the world with just one click
        — anonymously, instantly, and safely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike other chat services,
        <strong>we use AI for face detection and gender verification</strong> —
        ensuring full privacy for users while keeping it lightweight and fast.
        This technology helps accurately detect gender, preventing fake gender
        misrepresentation. Our platform focuses on speed, stability, and a clean
        UI/UX so you can meet strangers with zero delay.
